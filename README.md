# Centrifugal Pump Vendor Data Checklist

A offline, No installation required, desktop application for process engineers to systematically review and verify centrifugal pump vendor data sheets and performance curves.

## Overview

This application provides a structured checklist of 27 critical verification steps that process engineers must complete when reviewing vendor-supplied pump documentation. It includes built-in calculators, automatic data linking between steps, and the ability to save progress and generate reports.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **27-Step Checklist**: Comprehensive verification process covering all critical pump parameters
- **Visual Guide**: Real datasheet examples for each checklist step (Each step includes a real example from an actual pump datasheet to guide you. However, **datasheet formats vary between vendors**).
- **Interactive Calculators**: Built-in calculators for:
  - Flow rate ratios
  - Differential pressure and head
  - NPSHA (Net Positive Suction Head Available)
  - Rated power
  - BEP (Best Efficiency Point) checks
  - Shut-off pressure
  - Suction specific speed
  - And more...

### Intelligent Data Linking
- Automatic value transfer between related steps
- Real-time validation and range checking
- Dynamic status indicators for preferred and allowable operating regions

### User Interface
- **Visual Guide**: Sample images for each checklist step
- **LaTeX Formula Rendering**: For mathematical notation display
- **Color-Coded Status**: Instant visual feedback (Green=OK, Red=Not OK, Gray=Untouched)
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar
- **Referenced Notes**: Contextual notes appear automatically when relevant

### Data Management
- **Save/Load Progress**: Save your work as JSON files and resume later
- **Export Options**: 
  - Copy summary to clipboard (Excel-compatible)
  - Print report to browser (To save as PDF)
- **Autosave Prompts**: Never lose your work with unsaved changes warnings

## How to Use

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the `.exe` file
2. **Navigate Through Steps**: Use the checklist panel on the left or the Previous/Next buttons
3. **Review Each Step**: Read the description, formulas, and view the sample image
4. **Use Calculators**: Enter values in the calculator fields (results update automatically)
5. **Add Comments**: Document vendor notes or discrepancies in the comments section
6. **Mark Status**: Click âœ“ OK or âœ— Not OK buttons to mark each step

### Key Workflows

#### Saving Your Progress
- **File > Save**: Save to current file
- **File > Save As...**: Save with a new name
- Files are saved in JSON format for easy sharing and backup

#### Viewing Results
- **View > View Summary Report**: Opens a complete summary table
- From the report, you can:
  - Copy data to clipboard for Excel
  - Print to browser for PDF export

#### Starting a New Checklist
- **File > New**: Start fresh (prompts to save current work)
- **File > Load Progress**: Open a previously saved checklist

### Calculator Features

- Many calculators **auto-fill** with data from previous steps
- Example: Step 5 (Differential Head) automatically loads pressure values from Step 3
- All pre-filled values can be edited if needed
- Calculations update in real-time as you type

### Status Indicators

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ðŸŸ¢ Green | Step verified OK |
| ðŸ”´ Red | Issues found (Not OK) |
| âšª Gray | Not yet reviewed |
